# My Self-Distancing Diary

## About

We learned plenty about how social distancing is important to be healthy and safe after COVID 19 pandemic. Did you know that self-distancing would be as critical as the social distancing to take care of your psychological health? My self-distancing diary is an app that guides users to learn a research-proven emotion regulation strategy called “self-distancing” (Kross, 2011) which is an easy yet effective way to regulate mood and anxiety. COVID-19 increased countless risk factors for mental health challenges, such as social isolation, financial insecurity, and decreased family and social support. What’s concerning is that current health systems cannot sustain the widespread demand to help with these COVID-19-related mental health needs. My self-distancing diary would be an effective method when help from mental health experts is not available. Anybody can do it regardless of the insurance you have, age, ethnicity, or gender. Research shows that when people practice self-distancing, they are more likely to take control of their emotions, have less inter-personal issues, and also more likely to engage in productive problem-solving.


## How It Works

### Step 1. Recall the event
First, users would need to recall a stressful event that impacted them during the COVID pandemic. It can be about a sad, angry, or frustrating event. 

### Step 2. Take a step back 
Now, users should take a few steps back, mentally move away from the situation to a point where they can watch the event from a distance as if they were a fly on the wall

### Step 3. Write a self-distancing diary
Below is the instruction that users will get. 
“Please recall the event using a third-person voice to understand what happened to your distant self and the reasons underlying the emotions of the distant you. Rather than using "I", "My", "Me", "Mine", you will be using your own name or your pronouns (i.e., a third-person voice) to describe the event.”
We will collect the first name and also pronouns of users and give automatic edit suggestions to remind users to use a third-person voice, whenever they accidentally go back to relive a traumatic event by using a first-person voice (i.e., I, my, me, mine)
